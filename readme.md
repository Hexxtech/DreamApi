Legit DLC Unlocker for The Sims 4. The game still connects to EA servers, you can access the Gallery, your saves are safe.

### How to use
1. Download the latest release from the "Releases" page.
2. Put `dinput8.dll` and `g_The Sims 4.ini` in your `The Sims 4\Game\Bin` folder.

If you update your game - you just need a new `g_The Sims 4.ini` file. This way you won't have to download the unlocker every time a new DLC comes out. Unless the unlocker itself needs an update.

The `.ini` file is encoded in UTF-8. If you have any problems - open it in a text editor and save as UTF-8.
